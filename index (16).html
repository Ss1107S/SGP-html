<p style="margin: 20px 20px 10px 50px; color: green; background-color: rgb(251, 238, 118); font-size: 30px;">Site planning is a crucial stage. With the right approach to this issue, you can not only create comfortable conditions, but also avoid the need to change everything overnight, when all the buildings have already been erected, paths have been laid, and fruit and berry and ornamental crops have been planted. In addition, in the future, this will save you from possible conflict situations with neighbors whose land plots border yours.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Territory analysis.</li>
    <li>
    <p>First of all, you will need a plan of your site and adjacent, neighboring ones. You can make it yourself (with mandatory observance of the scale) or order it from a government agency or a private center dealing with cadastral and cartographic issues. Such a plan should indicate not only the boundaries of your site with others, but also the distance from the boundaries of the sites to neighboring residential and outbuildings, as well as a diagram of the laid communications.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Location of site boundaries.</li>
    <p>When planning the location of a house or outbuildings, you should take into account the standards regulating the distance not only to the fence or neighboring buildings, but also to communication lines, including power supply. Such standards are spelled out in documents that will help when planning the site in order to avoid fines and controversial situations with neighbors in the future.</p>
    <li>Slope level of the site.</li>
    <p>It is unlikely that you will have a level and other geodetic instruments on your farm. Therefore, it is best to order a geodetic map of the site. It will help to properly organize the site taking into account the relief features, and make any buildings as strong and durable as possible, as it will allow you to accurately orient the foundation of a house, barn, garage, etc. taking into account the level of the soil slope. This point is very important, since visually the differences in levels may not be determined, but in fact they can be quite significant. Alternatively, you can use a water level, but it is important to understand that this tool requires correct use and correct interpretation of the results.</p>
    <li>Orientation to the cardinal points.</li>
    <p>This parameter is most important when building a residential building. Without knowing how the building will be located in relation to the cardinal points, you will not be able to plan the placement of windows. It may turn out that the windows will be in the "blind" solar zone, and natural lighting in the rooms will be extremely poor. Also, the cardinal points are important when laying out a garden, vineyard, flower garden - light-loving plants simply will not be able to fully develop, constantly being in the shadow of your or neighboring buildings.</p>

<ul>        
    <li>Where to build a residential building?</li>
    <p>How to plan the site depends on where exactly you want to build a house. When dividing the territory, consider the most important factors:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>The fasade of a residential building is best "turned" to the street, but at the maximum permissible distance from it. This will reduce the level of noise and dust from the roadway.</li>
        <li>There should be enough space in front of the house or to the side of it to organize a small parking space. It is necessary not only for parking your personal car, but also for convenient access to repair and emergency services.</li>
        <li>Between the back wall of the house and the boundaries of the neighbor's plot, you need to leave space (taking into account the standards) for outbuildings. Their location in the backyard is the most convenient - they are hidden from prying eyes and at the same time they are quickly accessible to you.</li>
        </ol>
   
    <li>Zoning of the site.</li>
    <p>It is very important to plan the site taking into account all functional locations: this will allow you to foresee the relative location of all zones in advance, which will significantly increase the level of comfort. Such zones include:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Household zone. It includes sheds, workshops, cellars, poultry buildings, summer showers, etc.</li>
        <li>Garden and vegetable gardening area. If the garden plot needs to be planned taking into account the level of light, then the garden plot must be planned taking into account the boundaries of the neighboring plot.</li>
        <li>Relaxation area. You need to plan your site taking into account your preferences. So, if a swimming pool is installed in this area, it is important to take into account the terrain, the groundwater level and the location of the water supply, drainage communications and the availability of power grids (if a stationary pool with a filtration system is planned, etc.). It is also necessary to provide for the location of the yard - usually it is a flat paved area of any area.</li>
        </ol>

<ul>        
    <li>Arrangement of a recreation area.</li>
    <p>How to plan the site near the house, taking into account the recreation area, determine your hobbies and preferences.</p>
    <p>If you like to relax with friends and family to cook a barbecue, it is reasonable to organize a covered area that will allow you to spend time for pleasure in any weather. If you are a connoisseur of outdoor activities or you have children, the recreation area can be partially moved to the lawn to organize a sports or playground on it.</p>
    <p>In short, focus on your own tastes regarding recreation and plan the site based on personal preferences. An obligatory part of the organization of this location is the improvement of the territory, which depends on the level of illumination of the territory. This factor determines what exactly to plant - roses, conifers, wisteria or other ornamental crops that prefer bright or moderate light. And the proximity to the neighbor's plot determines whether it is possible to plant tall trees or lianas, or it is better to limit yourself to shrubs.</p>
    
    <li>Features of the layout of plots of different sizes.</li>
    <p>The layout of a standard plot and a whole "estate" of several hectares will be very different in terms of capabilities. But in any case, it is important to comply with the standards of development.</p>
    <p>Owners of small plots are recommended to reduce the territory of the garden and vegetable garden in favor of a recreation area, and move some of the outbuildings and functional premises to the basement. Also, two-three-storey construction significantly saves the situation. It allows you to significantly increase the total living area, and at the same time reduce the area occupied by the house.</p>
    <p>If on large plots you can make each zone in its own style, combining ethnic, classic, minimalist or other landscape design, then when dividing small areas, provide for the unity of styles in advance. This will create a holistic, organic design of the entire site.</p>
